This report explores the dataset containing quality and chemical properties in each wine for almost 5,000 observations.

# Univariate Plots Section

```{r echo=FALSE, Dimension}
dim(wine)
```
```{r echo=FALSE, Structure}
str(wine)
```
```{r echo=FALSE, summary}
summary(wine)
```

```{r}
univariate_plot <- function(x, binwidth = 0.1, data = wine){
  return (ggplot(data, aes_string(x = x, y = '..density..')) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = binwidth, color = '#FF7799', fill = '#F9E9E9') +
    geom_line(stat = 'density', color = '#FF0000', size = 0.8))
} 
```
### Quality
```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(wine, aes(quality)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = '#FF7799', fill = '#F9E9E9')
```
```{r echo = FALSE}
summary(wine$quality)
```
In the given dataset, the quality value is between 3 and 9. Almost wines have quality equals 5 or 6.
Create a new variable quality.range for rating the quality of the wines in bad (< 5), normal (5, 6) and excellent (> 6). Then plot the distribution of this new variable.
```{r echo=FALSE, Create quality.range}
wine$quality.range <- ifelse(wine$quality < 5, 'bad' , ifelse(wine$quality > 6, 'excellent', 'normal'))
wine$quality.range <- ordered(wine$quality.range, levels = c('bad', 'normal', 'excellent'))
```
```{r}
ggplot(wine, aes(x = quality.range, fill = factor(quality))) +
  geom_histogram(stat = 'count', binwidth = 1)
```
Now we can see there are much more normal wines than excellent or bad ones.

### Fixed Acidity, Volatile Acidity, Citric Acid
```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=5}
p1 <- univariate_plot('fixed.acidity', 0.2) + xlab('Fixed Acidity')
p2 <- univariate_plot('volatile.acidity', 0.02) + xlab('Volatile Acidity')
p3 <- univariate_plot('citric.acid', 0.02) + xlab('Citric Acid') 
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 1)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(subset(wine, select = c('fixed.acidity', 'volatile.acidity', 'citric.acid')))
```
Most wines have the fixed acidity between 6.3 and 7.3 g/dm^3, the volatile acidity between 0.21 and 0.32 g/dm^3, and a citric acid between  0.27 and 0.39 g/dm^3. 
Volatile acidity is too high can lead to an unpleasant, so we can see the distribution has the tail of the distribution extends to the right.
The distribution of citric acid has a molecular ion peak at 0.49 g/dm^3 and a lower one at 0.74 g/dm^3.

### Sulfur Dioxide, Sulphates
```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=5}
p1 <- univariate_plot('total.sulfur.dioxide', 10) + xlab('Total Sulfur Dioxide')
p2 <- univariate_plot('free.sulfur.dioxide', 5) + xlab('Free Sulfur Dioxide')
p3 <- univariate_plot('sulphates', 0.05) + xlab('Sulphates') 
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 1)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(subset(wine, select = c('free.sulfur.dioxide', 'total.sulfur.dioxide', 'sulphates')))
```
As we know, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine in low concentrations, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine.
It is not a surprise for us to see low sulfur dioxide levels. 
Both of free sulfur dioxide plot and total sulfur dioxide plot have a negative skew. 75% of the wines in this dataset has free sulfur dioxide below 46 mg/dm^3 and total sulfur dioxide below 167 mg/dm^3
Since sulfates can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, we can see a positive skew distribution again, in which most of the values fall under 21 mg/dm^3.

### Alcohol, Residual Sugar, Density
```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=5}
p1 <- univariate_plot('alcohol', 0.2) + xlab('Alcohol')
p2 <- univariate_plot('density', 0.001) + xlab('Density') 
p3 <- univariate_plot('residual.sugar', 1) + xlab('Residual Sugar')
grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol = 1)
```
```{r}
univariate_plot('residual.sugar', 0.1) + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  xlab('Log[10] Residual Sugar')
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(subset(wine, select = c('alcohol', 'residual.sugar', 'density')))
```
The distribution of alcohol is left skewed. Third quartile, 11.4, showing that 75% of the wines have an alcohol sugar value below 11.4%.
Transformed the long tail data (using a log10 scale) to understand the distribution of residual sugar better. The transformed residual sugar distribution appears bimodal with the values peaking around 2 or so and again at 9 or so. 
Density plot looks normally distributed. The mean is 0.9940, and the median is 0.9937. Most of the density values are between 0.99 and 0.1. A tidy amount of outliers is near 1.01 and 1.04.
### Chlorides, pH
```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=5}
p1 <- univariate_plot('chlorides', 0.002)
p2 <- univariate_plot('pH', 0.05) 
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol=1)
```

```{r}
summary(subset(wine, select = c('pH', 'chlorides')))
```
The distribution of pH has a bell shaped, with a mean and a median value nearly the same (3.18). In the dataset, the range of pH value is low, between 2.720 and 3.820. So I wonder how pH relates to the concentrations of acids.
The distribution of chlorides has a very long tail, and most of the chlorides values fall under 0.05 g/dm^3.

# Univariate Analysis
> **Tip**: Now that you've completed your univariate explorations, it's time to
reflect on and summarize what you've found. Use the questions below to help you
gather your observations and add your own if you have other thoughts!

### What is the structure of your dataset?
There are 4,898 white wines in the dataset with ten features, including 11 physicochemical properties and a  discrete variable quality providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?
The main feature of interest in the data set are quality. I would like to determine the features have a greater impact on the prediction of the quality of the wine.

### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your \
investigation into your feature(s) of interest?
Alcohol, citric acids, sugar, and sulfur dioxide likely contribute to the quality of the wine. I think alcohol, acids, and residual sugar probably contribute most to the quality after researching information on wine quality.

### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?
I have created one new categorical variable called quality.range to classify the wine quality based on the quality variable.

### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? \
Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form \
of the data? If so, why did you do this?
I log-transformed the right-skewed residual sugar and volume distributions, and then the transformed distribution appears bimodal with two peaks.


# Bivariate Plots Section

> **Tip**: Based on what you saw in the univariate plots, what relationships
between variables might be interesting to look at in this section? Don't limit
yourself to relationships between a main output feature and one of the
supporting variables. Try to look at relationships between supporting variables
as well.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
wine <- wine %>%
  mutate(pH.round = round(pH, 1),
        acids = fixed.acidity + volatile.acidity,
        ratio.citric.acid = citric.acid/acids, 
        ratio.volatile.acidity = volatile.acidity/acids,
         ratio.free.sulfur.dioxide = free.sulfur.dioxide/total.sulfur.dioxide,
         ratio.bound.sulfur.dioxide = 1 - free.sulfur.dioxide/total.sulfur.dioxide) 
```
```{r}
wine %>% 
  select(-X, -quality.range, -quality) %>%

  xlim(quantile(wine$pH, 0.01), quantile(wine$pH, 0.99)) +
  geom_smooth(color = 'red', method = 'lm') +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "blue", high = "black")

```
# Bivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the \
investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in \
the dataset?

### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features \
(not the main feature(s) of interest)?

### What was the strongest relationship you found?


# Multivariate Plots Section

> **Tip**: Now it's time to put everything together. Based on what you found in
the bivariate plots section, create a few multivariate plots to investigate
more complex interactions between variables. Make sure that the plots that you
create here are justified by the plots you explored in the previous section. If
you plan on creating any mathematical models, this is the section where you
will do that.

# Multivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the \
investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of \
looking at your feature(s) of interest?

### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?

### OPTIONAL: Did you create any models with your dataset? Discuss the \
strengths and limitations of your model.
